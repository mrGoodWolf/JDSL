# Usage

# works on Linux, Mac, and if you have run-scripts enabled for powershell on Windows it'll run on that too
./JDSL ./the_system
```

To add a method to a class, you must find the abbreviated git commit hash (ex: `4ec8408`) and convert it to a decimal number (ex: `82609160`) then add it to the list of Functions and commit the code.
